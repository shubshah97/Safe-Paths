# Safe-Paths


Predicting the safety of roads and regions within the city has been a go-to and a well-researched topic for a long time. There has been a lot of analytics that has been done on the crime data resulting in a lot of insights about the oc- curring crime events. There has been a lot of data that has been released publicly such as the Chicago Crime Dataset [2]. This inhibits the major hindrance of having a well de- fined and information-rich data which can be further used to extract some knowledge that might help in building a pre- dictive model and developing machine learning models that can categorize or predict the safety of a route. In this pa- per, we discuss our approach of predicting the safety level of a route using unsupervised machine learning technique in combination with bagging.
